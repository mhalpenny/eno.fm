# eno.fm

eno.fm is an experimental radio platform for the shifting VR zeitgeist - it maps radio stations to 3D space using spatially oriented javascript libraries. These libraries utilize cameras, lighting, distance, and physics, among other features. Each station creates a broadcast that reacts to the environment in a natural way. Sounds  can overlap between stations to give the illusion that the user is walking between broadcasting nodes. Similar station nodes are closer together all orbiting the centre, so as the user goes farther out the atmosphere of the music changes. The sight property is similar to conventional video games where distant objects are hidden by fog, but the user can always come back to the centre via a fog-proof sculpture.
